**ivim Script (Simplified and Recursive)**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

TMP_FILE="/tmp/innovim_tmp.txt"

# Function to refine AI response using Nvim
refine_with_nvim() {
    echo "$1" > "$TMP_FILE"
    nvim "$TMP_FILE"
    cat "$TMP_FILE"
}

# Main function
main() {
    echo "Share your vision with innovim:"
    read -r user_vision

    if [[ -z "$user_vision" ]]; then
        echo "Vision not provided. Exiting..."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Placeholder AI call. 'toolbuilder' could be replaced with a robust AI service.
    response=$(toolbuilder --mode=assistant --input="$user_vision")

    # Refine the response using nvim
    refined_response=$(refine_with_nvim "$response")
    echo "$refined_response"

    # Option to dive deeper (recursive call)
    echo "Would you like to refine or explore further? (yes/no)"
    read -r choice
    [[ "$choice" == "yes" ]] && main
}

main
```
