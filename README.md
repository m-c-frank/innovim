# neuralIDE(a) 🧠🛠️

Elevate your development journey with `neuralIDE(a)`, the intuitive neural command-line tool. It dynamically integrates with AI, letting you interact, refine responses using `EditFlow`, and immediately execute them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-c-frank/neuralidea.git
   cd neuralidea
   ```

2. **Make It Globally Available**:
   ```bash
   sudo cp neuralidea /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Run**:
   ```bash
   neuralidea
   ```

4. **Interact**:
   Simply enter your context or goal when prompted. For example:
   ```bash
   neuralidea "what's the next step to enhance project X?"
   ```

5. Responses from the tool can be dynamically refined. They can be:
   - Commands to run (`run:` prefix)
   - Files to save (`save:` prefix)
   - New prompts to respond to (`prompt:` prefix)

6. To quit, type `exit`.

## 💡 Tips

- Use the `neuralidea` tool as a brainstorming session with AI.
- Refine the AI suggestions directly in the provided editor before executing them.
- Discover new solutions, integrate dynamic code snippets, or get AI perspectives on various challenges.
